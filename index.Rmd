##### Hello! I'm an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at [Temple University College of Public Health](https://cph.temple.edu/).
##### 

I work on developing and validating new statistical methods to improve rigor in research involving complex biomedical data, especially from brain imaging studies. I also serve as a statistical collaborator on research projects in many other areas of medicine, public health, and social sciences.

I completed my PhD in Biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was a member of the [PennSIVE](https://www.dbeicoe.med.upenn.edu/pennsive) group. I was also previously a data analyst at the [Hospital for Special Surgery](https://www.hss.edu/) and an undergrad at [Columbia](https://www.columbia.edu/).
