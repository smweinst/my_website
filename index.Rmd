I am a fifth-year Biostatistics PhD candidate in the Graduate Group in Epidemiology and Biostatistics ([GGEB](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ggeb/)) at the University of Pennsylvania, a member of the Penn Statistics in Imaging and Visualization Center ([PennSIVE](https://www.cceb.med.upenn.edu/pennsive)), and a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).


My current research is primarily motivated by statistical issues in the analysis of complex multi-modal neuroimaging data. Under the mentorship of Dr. Russell (Taki) Shinohara and Dr. Kristin Linn, I've worked to develop a number of broadly applicable statistical methods, including [hypothesis tests for multiple neuroimaging modalities](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.25577), [spatial localization of inter-modal associations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.25.489462v1), and [feature extraction in the presence of nuisance variables](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.27.477859v1).

I also completed my MS in Biostatistics at Penn under the mentorship of Dr. Alisa Stephens-Shields where we proposed [leveraging observational data and propensity score modeling in the design of pragmatic clinical trials](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17407745211023840?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&).

Before starting at Penn, I graduated from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in 2016 with a BA in Statistics and Psychology. From 2016-2018, I worked as a data analyst in anesthesia research at the [Hospital for Special Surgery](https://www.hss.edu/).
