##### Hello! I'm an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics in the [Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://cph.temple.edu/departments-research/departments/department-epidemiology-and-biostatistics) in the [College of Public Health at Temple University](https://cph.temple.edu/).


##### 

My research focuses on statistical methods to improve replicability and interpretability of research about the human brain. I primarily work on methods for analyzing neuroimaging data, motivated by questions in mental health, neurodevelopment, and neurodegenerative disease. As a biostatistician, I'm also involved in collaborative projects across numerous areas.

Before joining the faculty at Temple, I was a PhD student at Penn, where I was a member of the Penn Statistics in Imaging and Visualization Center ([PennSIVE](https://www.dbeicoe.med.upenn.edu/pennsive)). I was also previously a data analyst at the [Hospital for Special Surgery](https://www.hss.edu/) and an undergrad at [Columbia](https://www.columbia.edu/).
