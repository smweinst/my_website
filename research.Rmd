In my current research, I am interested in developing statistical tools to extract and compare patterns in multimodal neuroimaging data.

### SPICE

My first dissertation project described the **S**imple **P**ermutation-based test of **I**ntermodal **C**orr**E**spondence, or **SPICE** test. SPICE uses a traditional permutation testing framework to test significance of the relationship between two imaging modalities:

A strength of the SPICE test compared to previous methods is that it does not depend on strong statistical assumptions.

This paper is now published in [*Human Brain Mapping*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.25577). I also received a runner-up student paper award from the Section on Statistics in Imaging at the Joint Statistical Meetings conference in 2021.

### PeDecURe
My second dissertation project is motivated by the challenge of adjusting for nuisance variables (e.g., confounders) in neuroimaging studies. We propose a method for feature extraction with built-in adjustment for nuisance variables: **Pe**nalized **Dec**omposition **U**sing **Re**siduals, or **PeDecURe**.

PeDecURe estimates primary directions of variation that both *maximize* covariance between a variable of interest $Y$ (e.g., Alzheimer's diagnosis) and residualized imaging features ($X^*$) and *mitigate* associations with nuisance variables $A$ (e.g., age and sex) through a penalty on the covariance between those variables and residualized features ($\widetilde X$):

where $X^*$ and $\widetilde X$ are matrices of residuals we obtain after fitting a model at each location in the image on $A$ and $Y$ and subtracting out the effects of $A$ and $Y$, respectively.

This work is now published in [*Biostatistics*](https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxac031/6661240?searchresult=1), and an R package is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/smweinst/PeDecURe).

### Ongoing work
I'm working on some extensions of the methods described above, including hypothesis testing and spatial localization of inter-modal associations (preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.25.489462v1)). I am also interested in multivariate approaches to quantifying and mapping image-phenotype associations.
